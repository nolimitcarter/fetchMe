Fetchme is a command-line system information tool written
in bash. Fetchme displays information about your operating 
system, software and hardware in an aesthetic and visually 
pleasing way.

The source code is highly documented and I hope it will
act as a learning resource when configuring it yourself
by using different operating systems.
