<p align="center">A minimalist system information tool written in shell.</p><br>

The goal of this project is to implement a simple system
information tool in POSIX `sh` using features built into
the language itself (*where possible*).

The source code is highly documented and I hope it will
act as a learning resource for POSIX `sh` and simple
information detection across various different operating
systems.

If anything in the source code is unclear or is lacking
in its explanation, open an issue. Sometimes you get too
close to something and you fail to see the "bigger
picture"!
